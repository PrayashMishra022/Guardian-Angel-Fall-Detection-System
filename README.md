# Guardian-Angel-Fall-Detection-System
## Overview
*Guardian Angel* is a real-time fall detection system aimed at improving personal safety for the elderly, solo travelers, and anyone at risk of falling without immediate assistance. Leveraging a combination of gyroscopic and accelerometric data, this system can detect falls accurately and initiate emergency responses if needed.

This prototype showcases a hardware implementation using an *MPU6050 sensor* and *ESP8266 microcontroller*, paving the way for future integration into smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices.

## Features
- *Real-Time Fall Detection*: Detects sudden falls using motion thresholds and acceleration analysis.
- *User Confirmation*: Sends an alert to verify if a fall occurred.
- *Automated Emergency Response*: Notifies emergency contacts and calls emergency services with location details if no user confirmation is received.
- *Adjustable Sensitivity*: Configurable thresholds to suit various scenarios and reduce false alarms.
- *Wearable Potential*: Can be integrated into smartwatches and other devices.

1. *MPU6050 Sensor*: Captures acceleration and angular velocity data.
2. *ESP8266 Microcontroller*: Processes sensor inputs and manages alerts.

    </p>
4. *Buzzer & LED*: Indicate alerts and fall detection during testing.

## How It Works
1. The *MPU6050 sensor* monitors motion and orientation changes.
2. When a fall is detected (exceeding pre-set thresholds and nearing zero acceleration), an alert is sent to the user.
3. If no response is received within 10 seconds:
   - *Buzzer and LED* are activated as a local alert.
   - *Emergency contacts* are notified.
   - *Emergency services* are called with the user's location (to be implemented in future iterations).
